            <h3>Dear Valued Customers</h3>

<p>We would like to express our sincere appreciation for your continued support and 
patronage at Sushi Heaven. We are excited to announce that </p>

<p>we will be opening a new restaurant, <b>Katsu Heaven</b>, located at 203 Martin Street, 
in the first week of April.</p>

<p>In order to prepare for the opening of <b>Katsu Heaven</b>, 
we will be temporarily closing Sushi Heaven starting in March. </p>

<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and we ask for your understanding.</p>

<p><b>Katsu Heaven</b> will feature a wider range of menu options, 
and a more spacious dining area compared to Sushi Heaven, 
which struggled to accommodate our many customers due to its small size.</p>

<p>Our entire staff is working hard to make sure that <b>Katsu Heaven</b> will 
provide the same quality of food and service that you have come to expect from us. </p>

<p>We will keep you updated on our progress and the exact opening date through 
    our website and social media channels.</p>

<p>Once again, we thank you for your continued loyalty and understanding 
    during this transition. We look forward to serving you at <b>Katsu Heaven</b>
     (203 Martin Street) soon.</p>

<p>Also, Sushi Heaven gift cards can be used at <b>Katsu Heaven</b> as well. Customers who do not wish to use their Sushi Heaven gift cards at Katsu Heaven, please email us and we will process a refund for you. Our email address is sushiheaven06@gmail.com.</p>

Sincerely,</p>
