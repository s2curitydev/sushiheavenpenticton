            <h3>Dear Valued Customers</h3>

            <p>We would like to express our sincere appreciation for your continued support and 
            patronage at Sushi Heaven. We are excited to announce that we will be opening a new restaurant, 
            <b>Katsu Heaven</b>, located at 203 Martin Street, 
            in the first week of April.</p>

            <p>In order to prepare for the opening of <b>Katsu Heaven</b>, 
            we will be temporarily closing Sushi Heaven starting in March. </p>

            <p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and we ask for your understanding.</p>

            <p><b>Katsu Heaven</b> will feature a wider range of menu options, 
            and a more spacious dining area compared to Sushi Heaven, 
            which struggled to accommodate our many customers due to its small size.</p>

            <p>Our entire staff is working hard to make sure that <b>Katsu Heaven</b> will 
            provide the same quality of food and service that you have come to expect from us. </p>

            <p>We will keep you updated on our progress and the exact opening date through 
                our website and social media channels.</p>

            <p>Once again, we thank you for your continued loyalty and understanding 
                during this transition. </p><p><b>We look forward to serving you at <b>Katsu Heaven</b>
                (203 Martin Street) soon.</b></p>

            <p>Also, <b>Sushi Heaven gift cards</b> can be used at <b>Katsu Heaven</b> as well. Customers who do not wish to use their Sushi Heaven gift cards at Katsu Heaven, please email us and we will process a refund for you. Our email address is sushiheaven06@gmail.com.</p>

            Sincerely,</p>
